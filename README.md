# Simulating and Analyzing Deadlock and Memory Allocation Strategies in Operating Systems
## Description
This project focuses on simulating two key aspects of operating system resource management: **deadlock handling** and **memory allocation**. It implements the **Banker’s Algorithm** to analyze and avoid deadlocks in process scheduling. Additionally, it compares the performance of three memory allocation strategies—**First Fit**, **Best Fit**, and **Worst Fit**—to determine their efficiency in different scenarios. The goal is to visualize and better understand how these strategies work and impact overall system performance through custom simulations.
